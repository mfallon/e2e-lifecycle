# Customer Journey Mapping

## What is it?

![Example Customer Journey Map](./assets/CJ1.png"Example Customer Journey Map")

A Customer Journey is a visual representation of how a Customer interacts with a service offering, depicting what they are thinking, feeling and doing to achieve their particular goal. It depicts a true experience, from the Customers' point of view, as they interact with the products, people and services they encounter along the journey. It helps create a shared understanding for the whole organisation to grasp the reality of the Customers' experience. It highlights both
positive and negative experiences along the journey. They can map the current experience (the “as-is”) during the research phase, as well as the intended future experience (“to be”) during Experience Roadmap and Experience Design phase.
Customer Journeys have become an essential part of the process for the business and IT. Customers demand great experiences in order for you to earn their business and retain their loyalty. It is necessary to compete on customer experience as the key brand differentiator.

## Why use it?

The importance of intentionally designed customer experience can have a significant improvement on revenue. They require rigor and effort, and often organisational change. But the benefits of these efforts far outweigh the costs of completing them. The Customer Journey Mapping is a collaboration method for cross functional teams.

## Instructions

1. Organise a workshop with a cross functional team that can contribute to the Customer Journey
2. Define the goal that you want the customer to achieve (for "to-be") or the customer goal you want to focus on (for "as-is"). The goal will direct the user behaviour through the experience
3. Gather and if necessary perform the needed research, both quantitative and qualitative, using methods Customer Interviews, ethnography, Contextual Inquiry, Customer Surveys, customer support/complaint logs, product Analytics, social media listening, and Competitive Analysis
4. Make an inventory of the various touchpoints and channels that apply. A touchpoint might be a singular micro-interaction within a single channel, or it may be a series of actions crossing multiple channels
5. Using a roll of poster paper and post-its, map out the journey steps for the selected user type. Map out a timeline of the journey, capturing events and activities
6. Add swim-lanes to capture customer thinking, feeling and doing at each step
7. Include a metrics swim lane and an insights swim lane to illustrate opportunities & challenges
8. Highlight the emotion of customers, both positive and negative points, based on research data. Capture delight points and pain points in the journey
9. At the bottom include any ideas captured during the process, or notes on opportunities or pain points
10. Iterate with the team. It can take many passes to capture the journey
11. Sketch the journey that best depicts the experience
12. Validate the Customer Journey by walking through the experience with all stakeholders and iterate
13. Digitise and distribute the Customer Journey
